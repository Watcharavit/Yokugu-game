          <h2>Why picking some word takes so long?</h2>
          <p>TL;DR : That word is not yet in our database.</p>
          <p>Whenever a user validate a new word, it gets stored to our database. So the next time we search for this word, we can just look up in our database, not calling an API.</p>

        <div>
          <h2>Why image and its definition are not related?</h2>
          <p>Sometimes words have more than one meaning. Ex. "Iron"  = an actual iron or gold.</p>
          <p>In the future we might use AI to match the definitions with the words, if time and money permits : ).</p>
